# Deployment Guide for Discord Bot

This guide will help you deploy your Discord bot to a cloud service so it can run 24/7 without keeping your computer on.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended for Beginners)

**Railway** is the easiest option for beginners. It offers a generous free tier and simple deployment.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Bot

1. Make sure your bot is working locally with all features configured
2. Create a GitHub repository and push your bot code
3. Ensure you have both `.env` and `data/bot-config.json` files configured
4. Test all 9 commands locally before deploying

#### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your bot repository
5. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project
6. Add your environment variables in the Railway dashboard
7. Your bot will start automatically!

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In the Railway dashboard, go to your project ‚Üí Variables tab and add:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id
DEV_ROLE_ID=your_developer_role_id
MEMBER_ROLE_ID=your_member_role_id
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url (if using verification/calendar)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key (if using verification/calendar)
WEB_PORT=3000
```

### Option 2: Heroku

**Heroku** is another popular option with a free tier (with limitations).

#### Step 1: Create Heroku Account

1. Go to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
2. Sign up for a free account

```

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

```bash
heroku config:set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
heroku config:set GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id
heroku config:set DEV_ROLE_ID=your_developer_role_id
heroku config:set MEMBER_ROLE_ID=your_member_role_id
heroku config:set SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
heroku config:set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### Option 3: DigitalOcean (For More Control)

**DigitalOcean** gives you a virtual server to run your bot with full control.

#### Step 1: Create Droplet

1. Go to [digitalocean.com](https://digitalocean.com)
2. Sign up and create a new Droplet
3. Choose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the operating system

#### Step 2: Connect to Your Server

1. Use SSH to connect to your server
2. Install Node.js v18+ and npm
3. Upload your bot files
4. Install dependencies and start the bot with PM2 for persistence

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup (Supabase)

### Why Use Supabase?

If you want these advanced features, you'll need Supabase:
- ‚úÖ Member verification system (`/verify` command)
- ‚úÖ Event calendar (`/calendar` command)  
- ‚úÖ Automatic membership expiration notifications
- ‚úÖ Admin tools for member management

### Setting Up Supabase

#### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (50,000 monthly active users included)
3. Create a new project
4. Choose a database password (save this securely)

#### Step 2: Create Required Tables

In the Supabase SQL Editor, run these commands:

```sql
-- Member list table (import your membership data here)
CREATE TABLE member_list (
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    student_id TEXT,
    email TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    campus TEXT,
    first_subscription_date TEXT,
    last_paid_date TEXT,
    end_date TEXT,
    faculty TEXT,
    new_renewal TEXT,
    payment_option_type TEXT
);

-- Verified members table (managed automatically by bot)
CREATE TABLE verified_members (
    discord_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    discord_username TEXT NOT NULL,
    verified_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Events table (optional - for calendar feature)
CREATE TABLE events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    start_time TIME,
    end_time TIME,
    location TEXT,
    category TEXT CHECK (category IN ('ctf', 'essentials', 'networking', 'pentesting')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Step 3: Create Required SQL Function

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This function is required for the `/check-expiring` command to work:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_expiring_members(expire_date text)
RETURNS TABLE (
    discord_id text,
    discord_username text,
    full_name text,
    end_date text
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        vm.discord_id::text,
        vm.discord_username,
        vm.full_name,
        vm.end_date
    FROM verified_members vm
    WHERE vm.end_date = expire_date;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 4: Import Your Member Data

1. Prepare a CSV file with your member list
2. Include columns: full_name, email, end_date (in DD/MM/YY format)
3. Use Supabase Table Editor to import the CSV
4. Verify data imported correctly

#### Step 5: Set Up Row Level Security (Optional)

For added security, enable RLS:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE member_list ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE verified_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow read access (adjust policies as needed)
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access" ON member_list FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access" ON verified_members FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access" ON events FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

#### Step 6: Get Your Credentials

1. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API
2. Copy your Project URL (looks like: https://xxx.supabase.co)
3. Copy your anon/public API key
4. Add these to your environment variables

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Service      | Free Tier | Monthly Cost | Features | Ease of Use |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Railway      | 500 hrs    | $5+ after limit | Auto-deploy, scaling | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Heroku       | 550 hrs    | $7+/month | Add-ons, simple deploy | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| DigitalOcean | None       | $6+/month | Full control, VPS | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

**üí° Recommended Setup**: Railway (bot hosting) + Supabase (database) = ~$5-10/month total

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your bot token** - Treat it like a password!
2. **Use environment variables** - Don't hardcode sensitive data in your code
3. **Regular backups** - Export your Supabase data periodically
4. **Monitor logs** - Check for unusual activity or errors
5. **Update dependencies** - Keep your bot and packages updated
6. **Secure your repository** - Never commit `.env` files to Git
7. **Rotate tokens** - Regenerate tokens if compromised
